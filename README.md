Write a vehicle tracking system. This should allow someone to track a car, truck, motorcycle, and boat. This system should track the fuel level and the number and state of tires on the vehicle. The fuel level should be able to be adjusted. The tire status should be able to be retrieved and modified. Tire state could be mileage, tread depth, or a simple good/fair/bad condition.

The user interface is up to you.

We will be calling the following week to schedule interviews, for those who are chosen from this exercise.

If you have something preventing you from being able to finish this task by the 7th, please email me at bdsmith@co.davis.ut.us
